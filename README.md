# PDF-extraction-and-dissection
In this project, 
 we developed a tool that performs pdf dissection on a given PDF file and presents the results in a user-friendly interface. 
 The tool begins by parsing the PDF file to extract its structural elements, such as text, images, and table and meta data. 
 It also performs sentiment analysis on a page of text and provides a summary of the end result. This project was done using python
